The Mess_signin system consists of 3 modules:-
1.admin module(In admin folder)
2.Mess Module
3.Student login system
The student login system is present in the attendance tab of mess module.One has to import data fro mysql folder and save it with the name mess_signin.sql.
The login credentials are provided in the database without any encryption. You can login from there.
Things not done yet include setting up attendance tables in both modules as like that of student in admin module and some front-end things(like proper display of error message and success message. only echo is there).
